Geographers and spatial analysts are under high demand across the environmental regulation and consulting, mining, government and private sectors as they can provide solutions using complex spatial data.\nThe extended major in Geographical and Spatial Science will equip students for a career in the environment, government or policy sectors, as a dedicated specialist, spatial analyst, or skilled multi-disciplinary scientist. It also offers a pathway into postgraduate study in most specialisations in the Maters of Environmental Science. The extended major further allows students the shortest possible pathway into four specialisations in Environmental Science Masters program at UWA (except the Environmental Economics and Environmental Rehabilitation specialisations, available with conversion (not for the CBM)).\nGraduates are in demand due to their GIS and spatial data skills, combined with fundamental scientific skills and training in team work, leadership and the excellent written and oral communication skills. Our graduates are the emerging future leaders solving the World's big issues.",

In this major, students engage with the ideas and processes involved in making interventions within built and natural environments. Practical application is supported by consideration of relevant theoretical and ethical aspects of architecture. Units in technology, science, history, theory and communication provide core knowledge of the architecture discipline. In these, students learn how to think and communicate through analytical, critical and representational modes. Running in parallel are the design studio units which offer an immersive and integrative experience. In these units, project-based learning develops students' propositional capacities in relation to a range of contextual concerns: theoretical, environmental, technical, material and spatial. Students learn how to conceptualise and design single buildings, urban configurations and landscapes in response to existing and emerging economic and social needs and desires. Manual and digital technologies and production methods are used to generate drawings, models and prototypes. \n \nThe major Architecture A includes an emphasis on discovery through drawing in both digital and analogue forms; grounding in cultural landscapes and integration of culturally diverse content; engagement with contexts that are local, regional and international; and an embedding across learning areas of a deep appreciation for sustainability.

    "description": "This Extended Major provides the foundation of studies for direct entry in to the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) degree for entry into professional practice as a podiatrist. This course prepares graduates with the clinical and professional attributes required for successful entry to practice.\nThe Major will encompass a wide range of disciplines within the health and medical sciences. It will provide students the background knowledge across all the biomedical scientific disciplines including, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, genetics, immunology, haematology, microbiology, pathology, pharmacology and public health. These disciplines will be integrated throughout course. Clinical and professional content will be presented in level 3, built around the core clinical conditions and presentations. Clinical communication, professional content and research skills will be presented throughout the Major. The Major will also include studies in Australian society and culture, Aboriginal health, migrant and refugee health. The Podiatric Heath specialisation will be taught across two 18 week semesters in Level 3. This Major is only available to students on direct pathways to the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine and those offered specific entry at time of admission.\nThe aim of this extended major is to make better use of the student's time in the third year of the major by including relevant clinically-oriented content and outcomes as part of the assured pathway to the doctor of podiatric medicine (DPM) degree. Targeted teaching of podiatry specific units will also begin in the third year alongside biomedical content. By rearranging current content this enables assured pathway students to be better prepared for clinical practice in the second year of the DPM. This will also allow vertical and horizontal integration within the curriculum.\nThe overall content of the course will not change except to remove some of the more generic material from third year and to replace it with more podiatry-specific material, thus creating an 'extended major' rather than a single major. This major involves detailed study of the life and health sciences, particularly podiatric health science, lower limb anatomy and physiology. Students will begin to develop their practical clinical skills by working in both simulated clinical laboratory environments in and functioning clinical spaces to learn and practice various podiatric clinical skills. There is an strong emphasis on professional identity and engaging in professionalism in practice \u2013 which is threaded longitudinally through level  three of the major. Discipline specific units in level three of this extended major include \u2013 body systems, anatomy and cutaneous science, biomechanics, research and evidence in practice, clinical podiatric practice and pharmacotherapeutics for podiatrists. It also contains foundational learning about the role of a podiatrist and introduces the student to pre-clinical practical podiatry training.The proposed changes also involve a revision of the order in which content is presented, partly by returning some clinical content back into the third year. These changes will improve the student experience for both assured pathway (Y3 of the PHMSC) and graduate entry students (DPM Y1), replacing the current overloaded curriculum that is not well integrated horizontally or vertically and has received negative feedback. Improving content integration while reducing the overall workload at this level of the articulated degree and removing content not particularly relevant to Podiatry will enhance learning and create a better student experience and professional identity.\nThis extended major which comproises of mostly podiatry specific units in the third year encompasses the proposal to have a \u201cconversion year\u201d where both sets of students (assured poathway year 3 and post graduate pathway year 1) undertake the same (and specifically podiatry-oriented) units. This will provide many advantages for the students as well as for the staff as one group will not have to \u201ccatch up\u201d to the other group. This conversion year will allow for the DPM to re-sequence content in first and second year of DPM to improve coherence, re-introduce clinical and professional skills development and small group teaching in the first year, re-\u00adintroduce orientation to podiatric medicine sessions that signpost milestones in becoming a podiatric medicine student and future podiatrist, re-establish a strong program in professional identity development at an early stage in the course for both assured pathway and graduate entry students and review and update assured pathway degree and major structure to ensure podiatric medicine and clinical practice is incorporated in final year of the 'podiatric health' major.",
